Thank you {insert group name} for your incoming liaison statement {insert title}.  The appropriate part(s) of the IETF community have been made aware of your message and logged the liaison in the IETF's Liaison Database {insert link}.

The IETF is a contribution driven organization, with a formal process described in [Internet Standards Process](https://www.ietf.org/process/process) (1). IETF positions require community rough consensus with input from Working Groups via the process managed by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG). Without going through the IETF's defined process to gather consensus, the IETF has no official position on any topic, including Liaison Statements.
